										<h2>Join us</h2>

									<h3>Apply to carry out research in the HLA group</h3>
									
									<p class="nolink">Applications to join our group are always extremely welcome from outstanding and enthusiastic Part II, PhD and postdoctoral candidates. Our main activity is organic synthesis, but we also have a strong interest in spectroscopy and physical organic chemistry, including photochemistry, electronic spectroscopy, photobiology, metal coordination chemistry and computational chemistry. Our projects cut across the traditional organic/inorganic/physical divides, and they often involve collaborating with physicists or physiologists. All members of the group learn about a wide range of chemistry and techniques. Please contact Harry directly by <b><a href="mailto:harry.anderson@chem.ox.ac.uk">email</a></b> if you would like further information.</p>
									
									<p class="nolink">Information specific to:<br><b>
										<a href="#part2">Part II</a><br><a href="#intern">Summer Students/Internships</a><br>
										<a href="#dphil">DPhil</a><br><a href="#postdoc">PostDoctoral Research</a></b><br></p>

									<p class="nolink"><a name="part2"><h4>Section 1: Information for prospective Part II students (internal Oxford 4th year):</h4></a><br> We have up to three Part II students in the group each year. Projects cover a wide range of topics, but they always involve synthesising new molecule and exploring the properties of these compounds, to learn how their behaviour relates to the molecular structure. Each Part II student works closely with an experienced postdoc or DPhil student. We frequently publish the results from Part II projects in international journals, and many Part IIs in our group have won thesis prizes.</p>

									<p class="nolink"> Contact Harry by <b><a href="mailto:harry.anderson@chem.ox.ac.uk">email</a></b> to discuss potential projects.</p>
									
									<a name="intern"><h4>Section 2: Information for prospective visiting research students:</h4></a><br>
									<p class="nolink"> The HLA group occasionally hosts visiting research students during June to September, for secondments lasting 2-3 months, however we do not always have space to accommodate summer visitors. If you are interested in carrying out research with the group, you will need to secure a grant to cover your living costs and travel. You will also need to arrange for two of your current academic mentors to send Harry Anderson letters of recommendation. Contact Harry by <b><a href="mailto:harry.anderson@chem.ox.ac.uk">email</a></b> to discuss available research areas.</p>
