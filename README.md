# README

This is a work-in-progress site for the Harry Anderson research group website (http://hla.chem.ox.ac.uk). Most of the dynamic grids and rows are handled by **bootstrap**.

## Note

The sidebar and header are **server-side includes** and can be found in the `includes` folder.

`base.inc` is used to define a base URL and is used for testing.
